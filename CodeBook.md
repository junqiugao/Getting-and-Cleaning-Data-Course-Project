  * std(): Standard deviation<br>
  * mad(): Median absolute deviation<br>
  * max(): Largest value in array<br>
  * min(): Smallest value in array<br>
  * sma(): Signal magnitude area<br>
  * energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.<br>
  * iqr(): Interquartile range<br>
  * entropy(): Signal entropy<br>
  * arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4<br>
  * correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals<br>
  * maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude<br>
  * meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency<br>
  * skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal<br>
  * kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal<br>
