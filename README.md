# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo contains the data information about wearable computing from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.[by README.txt] 

From my uploaded R script run_analysis.R, it saved the code than can solve the following problems.<br>
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject(uploaded as Tidy.txt).<br>

And the CodeBook.md contains the meanings of the variables.
